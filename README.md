#Job Huntr

###The simple and visual way to organize the job hunting process.

The purpose of this project was to build a Rails app that would be heavy in CRUD. My team mate and I completed the app in 10 days, and it was the first project we built outside of Dev Bootcamp. Challenges we overcame included implementing the devise gem, using AJAX to add notes, as well as how to work with nested resources. Also, it was our goal to make this app mobile friendly by using Bootstrap to make it responsive.
