          Job Huntr is built to be the simple and visual way to organize your job hunting process. Sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming trying to keep track of all the different jobs you may be applying for. Job Huntr simplifies this process by allowing you to have a place to put information that is relevant to each job, while being able to view you progress with all of your jobs at the same time. Give a try and let us know how you like it!
